Class 3 (January 16 2024)

#### PathORAM
1) Is there an assumption in this construction that the underlying plaintext data never changes? Would access pattern attacks / volume pattern attacks still be viable if the database was dynamic in nature? (High write workloads and low read workloads). 


* Workload Independence: 
	* Hide which data is accessed,
	* How old it is,
	* Access Pattern (Skewed vs Uniform)
	* Whether Same data being accessed. 
	* Whether access is a read or a write. 


<hr>

* Shorter summary, more on analysis and weaknesses and 
	* "This can be improved, by doing so and so"
* Justify why its a weakness.

Class 5 (January 23rd 2024)

Inference Attacks on Property-Preserving Encrypted Databases. 


Interesting point:
1) Frequency and Lp perform equally well for p=2,3 
	1) Does this mean that the histograms were all strictly ordered? 
2) Would it still work if full DOB is stored instead of birth year.
