What is the problem?


Why is it important?


Why is it hard? Why don't previous methods work?


What is the solution to the problem the authors propose?


What interesting research questions does the paper raise?


How does the solution perform?





1) Existing solutions (key-value)
2) Relational Data Model
3) Relation means correlated queries. 
4) My Project: Oblivious datastore for relational datastores.
5) Why Use waffle?
	1) Not dependent on hardware
	2) faster than oram. 
	3) handles correlated queries. 
6) Explain our solution:
	1) Need trace to make indexes on
	2) how would you do a simple select query?
	3) Explain with one proxy. Introduce scaling of proxy, explain why we need a load balancer.
